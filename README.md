# Delet_Invalid_Rows_Excel-VBA
In this project, data filter out through the B column. If the data in the B column doesnâ€™t support any date format, then the code will delete the entire row from the main sheet, transfer that data to the error sheet, and keep data that have date format in the B column of the main sheet.
